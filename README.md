<h1>FootballBet 2</h1>

<p>Another school project involving C# in a Winform project. I decided to make an upgrade of the previous project called <a href="https://github.com/hieungtom/football_bet_console_app"> Football_bet_console_app <a/>. Newly implemented user functionality such as each user having their own money bank and logging in / out + registering. Passwords are hashed, user can't be created with a same name as an user that was already registered. Basic functions still preserved i.e. deposit / withdrawl from the money bank, creating a bet and getting instant result of the bet.
</p>

<p>Possible improvements for the future could be not being able to bet on matches that the user already has made a bet on, loading matches from a database instead of an XML file.</p>
